# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various property features such as area, number of rooms, location-related factors, and other attributes.  
The goal is to build and compare **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression** models to identify the best-performing approach.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Loaded and analyzed real-world housing dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy
- Implemented Linear Regression as a baseline model
- Implemented Random Forest Regressor for improved performance
- Model evaluation using RMSE and R² score
- Compared models to select the best-performing one

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  

---

## 🤖 Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

Random Forest showed better performance compared to Linear Regression after feature engineering.

---

## 📈 Results
- Improved prediction accuracy using Random Forest
- Reduced RMSE after preprocessing and feature engineering
- Identified important features influencing house prices
